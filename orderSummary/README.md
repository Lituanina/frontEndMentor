## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've had a gentle introduction to accessibility, and the importance of HTML landmark elements.


### Continued development

I would like to improve the organization of the stylesheet.
For future projects, I would like to read up on and apply BEM (or SMACSS) and use a CSS pre-processor.

I also need to read up on accessibility and incorporate it into the design, rather than apply it as an afterthought.
